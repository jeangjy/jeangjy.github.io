### Sleep and Fatal Vehicle Crashes: Evidence from Sunset Time in the United States
Adequate sleep is critical for general healthy functioning. This paper studies how sleep affects fatal vehicle crashes. The sleep data is from American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and the vehicle fatality data is from Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). Using sunset time as instrument, I find that a one-hour increase in monthly sleep leads to a decrease of about 0.035 fatal crashes per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT), equivalent to a 2.4% reduction in fatalities in the short run. Alternatively scaled, an extra hour of daily sleep reduces one fatal crash in 2,724 years if one drives 100 miles per day. However, I find there is no significant long run effect of sleep on fatal vehicle crashes. Using spatial regression discontinuity in the timing of sunset at a time-zone boundary, I find that people sleep less if they live on the side of the time-zone border where the sunset time is later using data from 2004-2013 but the results are the opposite if using data from 2014-2019. Traffic fatality is lower on the side of late sunset using data from 2004-2013 and higher on the side of late sunset using data from 2014-2019.

### Caste Differences in Child Growth: Disentangling Endowment and Investment Effects (with [Joseph Cummins](https://www.josephrcummins.com/), [Anaka Aiyar](http://www.anaka-aiyar.com/), [Neha Agarwal](https://sites.google.com/site/agarwalnehaecon/home), Vaishali Jain, Andrew Bergmann) submitted

Using the fourth round of the Indian National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 4), and subsequently replicating our results using the fifth round (NFHS-5), we document differential child physical growth patterns across caste groups in India, demonstrating that lower caste children are born shorter and grow less quickly than children from higher-caste households. We then show that, in line with work from previous rounds of the NFHS, these differences are largely explainable by observable covariates, particularly maternal characteristics and household wealth variables. However, unlike previous research, our models reveal that the influence of these variables changes as children develop, and suggest that caste-gaps are the result of multiple channels of causal effects impacting the child growth process at different stages of development. Using age-disaggregated decomposition methods, we demonstrate that health endowment related variables largely explain birth length gaps, and that investment related variables become increasingly influential as children age. Children from low caste households thus face two margins generating height gaps as they age: a persistent endowment effect present from birth, and a post birth investment effect that exacerbates the initial deficit.

### How does Air Pollution Affect Sleep? Survey and Social Media Evidence from the United States (with [Da Gong](https://dadasmash.github.io/dagong.github.io//), Zhuocheng Shang)

Using the Twitter data, American Time Use Survey (ATUS) on sleep, and satellite data on pollution, we aim to answer the following questions in our research: How does air pollution affect the sleep of people in the United States? Specially, we will use two instrument variables (IVs) including thermal inversion and Clean Air Act (CAA) to estimate the causal impact of pollution on sleep. With access to the Twitter data, our project aims to utilize tweets as a measure of sleep amount in the United States, and to study the impact of pollution on sleep. Furthermore, we will validate accuracy of measure from Twitter data by comparing it with survey data from the ATUS. The use of Twitter data has the potential to provide valuable insights into sleep patterns, especially in regions where sleep surveys are not readily available. It could be used in future studies to explore various topics on sleep quality and its associated health outcomes.
